# NYPD Precincts and Allegations of Misconduct

This is an interactive map that shows NYC's police precincts along with the number of total allegations of misconduct tied to each precinct as determined from ProPublica's database of over 33,300 allegations.  It's based on code I used to make [knowyourcops.com](http://knowyourcops.com).  This is a simple front-end application that uses **React** and **d3**.  It was made for a presentation on visualizing public datasets for **Recurse Center's Never Graduate Week, 2021.**
