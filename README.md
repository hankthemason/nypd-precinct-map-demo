# NYPD Precincts and Allegations of Misconduct

This is an interactive map that shows NYC's police precincts along with the number of total allegations of misconduct tied to each precinct as determined from ProPublica's database of over 33,300 allegations.  It's based on code I used to make [knowyourcops.com](http://knowyourcops.com).  This is a simple front-end application that uses **React** and **d3** that is meant to serve as an example of how to visualize public data using GeoJSON files and d3.   

## Run It Locally

`Git clone` the repo, and then navigate to the directory.  
 Run `npm run start` or `yarn start`, and then navigate to http://localhost:3000.
